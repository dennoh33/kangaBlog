        <h2>The Great Migration: An Overview</h2>
        <p>The Great Migration primarily occurs in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Spanning approximately 1,800 miles, the journey is driven by the animals' instinctual search for fresh grazing grounds and water sources. The migration typically follows a cyclical pattern, starting in the Serengeti around April and moving north to the Maasai Mara by July. The animals return south around October, completing the loop.</p>
        <p>This epic journey is not without its challenges; predators such as lions and crocodiles prey on the migrating herds, adding an element of raw survival to the spectacle.</p>
